Electric Power Market with Intermittent Power Generators and Stability Contraints


We are discussing a stochastic market
clearing problem to deal with uncertainty in electric power
generation due to renewable generators. These fluctuations
arise due to several imperfections in weather forecast data
as well as multiple transmission line constraints. The
forecast errors can give rise to imbalances in demand and
supply. Inertial response and Primary Frequency
Response (PFR) decline when conventional generation is
displaced by renewable energy, that is not providing the
needed control capabilities. The high variability of wind
and solar imposes additional regulation burden on
remaining conventional generation which motivates a need
for new resources to provide Primary Frequency Response
(PFR), Secondary Frequency Response (SFR) and Tertiary
Frequency Response (TFR). In this paper, we formulate an
Optimal power flow model with stability constraints which
are frequency stability and voltage stability for a 3-bus
system.
